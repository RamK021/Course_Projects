## Course Project || A Web Platform for Air Quality Monitoring             

* Developed an AQI Prediction Model and corresponding Flask web application, providing users with a valuable tool to estimate air quality levels based on environmental factors.
* Employed libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and train the model, and evaluate its performance in predicting air quality levels.
* Implemented a Flask web application to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting the AQI based on user-input environmental parameters.
* Designed and integrated an intuitive front-end and robust back-end functionalities to handle user inputs, communicate with the prediction model, and display real-time predictions on the web interface.
